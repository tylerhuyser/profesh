# Profesh

**Profesh** is an app that helps job-seekers find jobs and organize their job hunt.

## Description:

Profesh is an app that assists job seekers throughout their job hunt. The app provides a directory of job listings that users can refine using various search parameters, including location, title, experience, and company. More importantly, the app provides a series of tools that enable the user to track their journey with each individual opportunity, from interview to offer. 

Using Profesh, job-seekers will be able to take the most advantage of opportunitity and land their dream career.

## API & Data Sample

To provide maximum value to the user, Profesh leverages the power of two APIs. 

A curated list of potential jobs provided by *The Muse*'s Jobs API and accessed using a GET request. When a user finds a job that they like, they may save the job as an *opportunity* and begin to track it using the Opportunity Tracker.

Opportunities are stored and accessed using *Airtable*. The Airtable API allows users to perform full CRUD functionality (create, read, update, and destroy) over the course of their job hunt.

## MVP

The MVP for my project will focus on building the "tracker" feature of Profesh. Components include:

* Search bar (to search saved opportunities)

* Opportunity cards (displaying high-level information on the tracked opportunity)

* Opportunity Details (displaying detailed information on the opportunity)

* "Add" Button (allowing users to Post a new opportunity to AirTable API)

* "Add" Form (a form containing various fields concerning the new opportunity)

* Bottom Navigation Bar (allowing users to navigate to other pages in the app)

## Post-MVP

My Post-MVP will include:

* Home Page

* Job Search Page

    * Produces a list of jobs displaying high-level information. When a user selects a job....
 
    * A job component opens, which includes detailed information on the job.

## API

I will be using two APIs to achieve my MVP.

**MVP**

For MVP, AirTable will be used to track opportunities that the user has "saved" to their profile. The user will also be able to "add" jobs not generated by the app's "search" function. Thus, users will be able to view (i.e. "Get"), save (i.e. "Post"), update (i.e. "Put"), and delete (i.e. "Delete") opportunities using the AirTable API.

**POST-MVP**

For Post-MVP either Indeed, ZipRecruiter, or The Muse will be used to generate a list of jobs that match the user's search paramters (i.e. "Get" request). 

Details on the job listings arrays below:

1. Indeed: 
 
    * Documentation: https://www.indeed.com/publisher
  
    * API Link: TBD
  
    * Request Limitations: TBD
  
2. The Muse: 

    * Documentation: https://www.themuse.com/developers/api/v2
  
    * API Link: https://www.themuse.com/api/public/jobs  
  
    * Request Limitations: You can register your app and use the provided API key by passing it in as the query parameter api_key. This will allow you to make up to 3600 requests per hour. If you don't register your app and provide an api_key query parameter, you're limited to 500 requests per hour.


3. ZipRecruiter:

    * Documentation: https://www.ziprecruiter.com/partner
  
    * API Link: TBD
  
    * Request Limitations: TBD

    * Understanding of FlexBox

* *Weaknesses*:

    * Difficult to reign in scope
 
    * Prioritization of MVP

* *Opportunities*:

    * To create an app that can provide realistic value
